let use create the inventoryentries table it is ledger like a system  and every operation of the this table will be store in the auditlogs table to maintain the records of the inventoryentries table and the table is like a ledger so have to create a sql to get the total balance of the inventoryentries table and this table is handle by both master and employee 
if employee makes a mistake that action is displayed in the auditlogs table and master can rectify the mistake by deleting that log from the auditlogs table and the inventoryentries table should get updated automaticall we can also delete the operation that employee did and the when we call the getbalance api it should get the total balance of the inventoryentries table with new update
