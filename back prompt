Excellent question. The reference_id in your 
InventoryEntry
 model is a common and very useful field in inventory management systems.

Its main purpose is to link an inventory movement to a source document or a related business process. This provides traceability and context for why the inventory level changed.

Think of it as a way to answer the question, "This stock was moved, but why?"

Here are some common examples of what you would store in the reference_id:

Purchase Order (PO) Number: When you receive new stock from a supplier, you'd put the PO number here.
Sales Order (SO) or Invoice Number: When you ship goods to a customer, you'd use the sales order or invoice number.
Work Order Number: If you're using items for manufacturing, this would be the number of the work order that consumed the parts.
Transfer Order Number: When moving stock between two of your own warehouses or locations.
Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA): For items being returned by a customer.
In your 
test_inventory_api.sh
 script, you are already using it correctly:

For a stock-in, you use "reference_id": "PO12345".
For a stock-out, you use "reference_id": "SO54321".
By making it an optional VARCHAR(100), you've designed it correctly. It's flexible and only needs to be used when a corresponding document exists. This field is crucial for auditing, tracking, and financial reconciliation.
